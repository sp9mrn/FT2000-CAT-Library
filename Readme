This library is perhaps first attempt to use the new CAT command of Yaesu with Arduino
This new Cat command set is used by all modern Yaesu rigs. 

Users write functions to control their rigs using Touch screens, buttons, encoders etc
Some of these functions could be linked to the CAT library or may be used in 
the CAT library.

Combining the two should not be much difficult. Most of the CAT commands 
in this library are for reading or changing frequency/(ies) of the VFO(s) for transmit/receive ,
reading or manipulaing the modes and similar related functions. 

Modern transceivers have a large number of commands out of which only a handful
are used in day to day operations of digital communication prgrams.
Only these few commands are included in this library.

Any one who wishes to improve the current library is welcome to help. Just keep the credits.
